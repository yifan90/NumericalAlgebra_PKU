# NumericalAlgebra_PKU

All the code are included in n_algebra.h and n_algebra.cpp.

There were 4 assignments. To see HW_X (X = 1,2,3,4) just use the following commend in terminal 

g++  n_algebra.h n_algebra.cpp. HW_X.cpp

The content include basic numerical algebra operations, like solving linear systems using Gauss-Seidel, QR decomposition and so on.

Code were written long time ago and I didn't have a good coding habbit back then (in naming variables, no comments...)

Just upload here to keep the record.
